Below are my (Fred's) thoughts on the Preparing to Teach workshop at JSM 2018

## Overview: Use the GAISE report in our "teaching statistics" class

The most striking suggestion, which might impact the short course that Rick & I have taught, is the use of the GAISE report as a guide for teachers. 

## GAISE 2016 report

The GAISE college report (from 2016) is here: http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/GAISE/GaiseCollege_Full.pdf

Resources related to the GAISE report, including a webinar on using the GAISE report in college classrooms, is here: http://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Guidelines-for-Assessment-and-Instruction-in-Statistics-Education-Reports.aspx

6 suggestions from the 2016 GAISE report are nearly identical to those in the original 2005 GAISE report: 

1. Teach statistical thinking.
        - Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decisionmaking.
        - Give students experience with multivariabl thinking.
2. Focus on conceptual understanding.
3. Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
4. Foster active learning.
5. Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.
6. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.

## Ideas for improving our (Rick and Fred's) short course on teaching statistics

- Do we introduce the GAISE report on first day of class? 
- Require reading of executive summary before first class?
- Encourage (or require) class members to incorporate (and explicitly state) how their mini-projects support the GAISE report suggestions?

Idea: What about developing peer review of teaching materials?
